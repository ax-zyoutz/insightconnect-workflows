## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

This workflow leverages InsightConnect's Parameters feature. This feature allows variables used multiple times throughout a workflow to be entered once and then referenced throughout the workflow.

There are two parameters you will need to configure in order to complete setup of your workflow:
* `Team Name`: The Microsoft Teams team name in your environment where the workflow should be triggered and respond
* `Channel Name`: The Microsoft Teams channel name in your environment where the workflow should be triggered and respond (the channel should exist in the aforementioned team)

## Usage

*This workflow will only trigger in the channel specified in the Microsoft Teams workflow steps.*

To run the workflow, send a message to the specified Microsoft Teams channel starting with the command `!lookup-host`.

For example:

* `!lookup-host hostname123`
* `!lookup-host 10.1.2.34`

The workflow will post matching host information to the specified Microsoft Teams channel.
