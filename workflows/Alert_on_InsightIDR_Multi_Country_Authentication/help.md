## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

This workflow leverages InsightConnect's Parameters feature. This feature allows variables used multiple times throughout a workflow to be entered once and then referenced throughout the workflow.

There are two parameters you will need to configure in order to complete setup of your workflow:

* Email Recipient: Recipient for email alert
* Required AD Group DN: Active Directory user group to monitor

To begin, select "Parameters" either from the Workflow Control Panel or from the Builder to begin configuration.

After configuring the parameters, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.
