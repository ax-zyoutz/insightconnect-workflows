## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

### InsightVM

This workflow requires a pre-configured InsightVM (or Nexpose) asset group in order to list and delete inactive assets.

1. Create a new dynamic asset group in InsightVM with a filter similar to this: **`Last scan date earlier than 90 days ago.`**
2. Save the asset group configuration and navigate to the Asset Group page. View the URL in your web browser to find the `Group ID`. For example, if my console URL is `https://10.1.2.3:3780/group.jsp?groupid=123`, then my `Group ID` is `123`.

Once you have found the Group ID, move on to configure the Get Inactive Assets step in the InsightConnect workflow.

### InsightConnect

Once the workflow has been imported:
1. Update the first step with the team name and channel name to suit your Microsoft Teams environment by editing the input with the preset text of `change_me` to match the team and channel to monitor.
2. Edit the `Get Inactive Assets` step. Insert the `Group ID` into the first input field, replacing the existing number, and save the step.
3. Activate the workflow in order to trigger it.
