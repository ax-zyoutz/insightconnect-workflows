## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **the first Microsoft Teams step will need the team name and channel name updated to suit your Microsoft Teams environment!** Edit the input with the preset text of `change_me` in the first Microsoft Teams step in the workflow.

After configuring the first step, activate the workflow and then issue a Microsoft Teams command to trigger it. 

### Usage

*This workflow will only trigger in the channel specified in the Microsoft Teams workflow steps.*

To run the workflow, send a message to the configured Microsoft Teams channel starting with the command `!quarantine-endpoint` or `!unquarantine-endpoint` and then provide the identifier for the host you would like to take the action on.

For example:
* `!quarantine-endpoint example-host`
* `!unquarantine-endpoint 198.51.100.100`
* `!quarantine-endpoint f5b83fa335f44c38b456fb94d515f196`
