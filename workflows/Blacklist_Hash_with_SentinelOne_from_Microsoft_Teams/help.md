Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **each Microsoft Teams step will need the channel name updated to suit your Microsoft Teams environment!** Edit the input with the preset text of `change_me` in the first Microsoft Teams step in the workflow.
