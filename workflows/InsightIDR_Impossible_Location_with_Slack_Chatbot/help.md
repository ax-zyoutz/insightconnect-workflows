# Description

This workflow automates the process of parsing all IP addresses associated with the InsightIDR alert, and enriches them with geo locations and threat intelligence. From the findings, the workflow will automatically post a Slack response prompt to the security team as a point of escalation. Based upon the incident responders decision, the address will be blocked by updating a Palo Alto Pan-OS policy.
