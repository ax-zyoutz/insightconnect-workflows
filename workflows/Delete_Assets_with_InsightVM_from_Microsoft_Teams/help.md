## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Update the first step with the team and channel name to suit your Microsoft Teams environment by editing the inputs with the preset text of `change_me` to match the team and channel to monitor.

## Usage

To run the workflow, send a message to the channel you are monitoring starting with the command `!delete-asset`.

For example:
`!delete-asset 12345`

You can also delete multiple assets at once. For example: 
`!delete-asset 12345 32145`

This will retrieve information about the assets you would like to delete. It will also present you a command to use if you would like to confirm deletion of the assets. 

To confirm deletion of an asset or assets: 
`!delete-asset-confirm 1234`

or 

`!delete-asset-confirm 1234 2345`
