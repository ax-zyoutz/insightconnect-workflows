## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **the first Microsoft Teams step will need the team name and channel name updated to suit your Microsoft Teams environment!** Edit the input with the preset text of `change_me` in the first Microsoft Teams step in the workflow.

After configuring the Microsoft Teams steps, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.
 
An optional whitelist can be added to the Broadcom Symantec Endpoint Protection `Quarantine` action. To use this list 
add MAC addresses or hostnames in the following format (colons or hyphens are acceptable for MAC addresses) `["00:A0:C9:14:C8:29", "example-host"]`

### Usage

*This workflow will only trigger in the channel specified in the Microsoft Teams workflow steps.*

To run the workflow, send a message to the specified Microsoft Teams channel starting with the command `!quarantine-endpoint` or `!unquarantine-endpoint`.

Your chat bot will reply when the workflow completes.
