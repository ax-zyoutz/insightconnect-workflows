# Description
Orchestrate the remediation of high risk vulnerabilities by generating and uploading scan reports from InsightVM to
Automox Vulnerability Sync in order to stage or immediately remediate vulnerabilities and reduce risk. 

This workflow connects vulnerability and patch management programs by reducing the need to manually send vulnerability 
reports between Security and IT Operations teams. By automating a frequently tedious and high-friction process, teams 
are able to reduce mean-time-to-remediation, decrease environment risk, and improve their endpoint and patch management
processes.

# Key Features

* Connect vulnerability and patch management programs with a single workflow
* Immediately create remediation tasks within Automox based on InsightVM scan results
* Automatically apply patches to remediate faster and reduce environment risks

# Requirements

* Automox API key
* InsightVM Console URL and account credentials
* InsightConnect license

# Documentation

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. 
Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

There are three workflow parameters you will need to configure in order to complete setup of your workflow:
* `Automox Organization ID`: The identifier of the Automox organization.
* `CVEs in Scope`: Comma separated list of CVEs in scope for immediate remediation between InsightVM and Automox.
* `Auto-Approve Tasks`: Whether to auto-approve and apply patches for identified vulnerabilities immediately.

## Usage

*This workflow will only trigger on the successful completion of an InsightVM scan.*

Once configured, the workflow does not need manual intervention for it to run. On successful completion of an InsightVM
scan, a scoped report based on both the scan ID and CVE IDs will be generated and uploaded to Automox. If the 
auto-approval of tasks workflow parameter is enabled, patches will be immediately applied to the matched hosts.

The workflow will complete with a `Final Report` artifact detailing the outcome of the job, as well as links to the
resulting Automox Vulnerability Sync batch and tasks.
